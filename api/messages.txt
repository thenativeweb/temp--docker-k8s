My god, it's full of stars!
I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit.
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.
Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?
It can only be attributable to human error.
You shall not pass!
